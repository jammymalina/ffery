# ffery ü¶Ä

**ffery** (short for *file f‚ú®ery*, use with caution!) is a small command-line utility written in Rust designed for performing bulk operations on files within a directory.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This tool modifies files directly on your filesystem based on the commands given. Operations might be irreversible. **Always back up your data before using `ffery` or test it in a safe, non-critical directory first.**

## Features

Currently, `ffery` supports the following command:

*   **`remove-prefix`**: Removes a specified prefix from filenames matching a given extension within a target directory.
*   **`copy-music`** Recursively copies files and directories from a source location to a destination, with specific sorting logic designed for music players that rely on file copy order. Many simple music players (especially older MP3 players or car stereos reading from USB drives) play tracks in the order they were written to the filesystem, not necessarily alphabetical or based on track numbers in tags

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed (see [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)).
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jammymalina/ffery
    cd ffery
    ```
3.  **Build and Install:**
    ```bash
    cargo install --path .
    ```
    This will build the `ffery` binary and place it in your Cargo binary path (`~/.cargo/bin/` by default), making it available system-wide.

## Usage

`ffery` is run from the command line.
